# How to Use Your AI Persona

## Quick Start: Using Your Persona

**Step 1: Copy Your Persona Instructions**
- Copy the complete persona from your results page
- Paste it into any AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) as your first message

**Step 2: Start Working**
- Begin with: "I need help with [your specific task]"
- The AI will respond according to your custom persona's style and expertise

**Step 3: Reference When Needed**
- If the AI forgets its role, just say "Remember your persona instructions"
- For new conversations, paste the persona again to maintain consistency

## Set and Forget: Using Custom Instructions

For even better convenience, add your persona to the built-in custom instruction features in popular AI platforms:

### ChatGPT Custom Instructions
Access via your username (bottom-left) â†’ "Custom Instructions." You'll see two text boxes with a 1,500-character limit each.
- **First box ("What would you like ChatGPT to know about you?")**: Add your role, industry, and context from your persona
- **Second box ("How would you like ChatGPT to respond?")**: Include your persona's communication style and approach
- Custom instructions apply to all new conversations automatically

### Claude Projects
Access via the Projects section on the left sidebar. Create a new project and add custom instructions in the project settings.
- Create a dedicated project for your specific role or workflow
- Upload relevant documents to provide context (200k token limit)
- Set custom instructions that apply to all chats within that project
- Perfect for team collaboration and maintaining consistent AI assistance

### Perplexity Spaces
Create a Space via the Spaces section. Add custom instructions that give the AI a specific persona or directions on how to respond.
- Ideal for research-focused work with your persona's expertise
- Upload files and set custom web sources for specialized knowledge
- Choose between web browsing mode or direct AI conversation
- Great for organizing research by topic or project

### Benefits of Using Custom Instructions
- **No repetition**: Set once, works for all future conversations
- **Consistent results**: Every interaction follows your persona's guidelines
- **Context retention**: Platform remembers your preferences and working style
- **Team alignment**: Share projects/spaces with colleagues for unified AI assistance

## How to Maximize Your Persona's Impact

### 1. Start Small, Build Up
- Use your persona for one type of task first
- Once you see results, expand to related areas
- Refine based on what works best

### 2. Be Specific in Your Requests
**Instead of**: "Help me write an email"

### 3. Provide Context When Needed
- Share relevant background information
- Mention deadlines or constraints
- Include examples of what you liked/didn't like previously

### 4. Iterate and Improve
- If responses aren't quite right, give feedback: "Make this more formal" or "Focus more on the technical details"
- Note what works well to inform future persona updates

### 5. Use Across Different Platforms
- Your persona works with any AI assistant
- Copy it to different tools for consistent results
- Share with team members for unified AI assistance

# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Usage

**Q: Do I need to use the exact persona text every time?**
A: Yes, for best results. The persona contains specific instructions that ensure consistent, high-quality responses tailored to your needs.

**Q: Can I modify my persona after it's created?**
A: Absolutely! Your persona should evolve with your needs. Edit the instructions, add new requirements, or refine the communication style as you learn what works best.

**Q: How long should I expect my persona to be?**
A: Most personas are 200-500 words. This provides enough detail for effective guidance without being overwhelming for the AI to process.

## Technical Questions

**Q: Which AI platforms work with personas?**
A: Any text-based AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.). You can either paste your persona as the first message in a new conversation, or add it to built-in custom instruction features for automatic application.

**Q: Do I need to paste the whole persona every time?**
A: Not if you use custom instructions! ChatGPT's Custom Instructions, Claude Projects, and Perplexity Spaces all let you set persona instructions once and apply them automatically to new conversations. For manual use, you'd paste it for new conversations but the AI remembers within the same chat.

**Q: How do I set up custom instructions in different platforms?**
A: 
- **ChatGPT**: Click your username â†’ "Custom Instructions" â†’ fill the two text boxes (1,500 character limit each)
- **Claude**: Go to Projects â†’ Create Project â†’ Set custom instructions in project settings
- **Perplexity**: Create a Space â†’ Input Custom Instructions for the AI

**Q: Can I use one persona for multiple types of tasks?**
A: Yes, but specialized personas typically work better. Consider creating different personas for distinct types of work (e.g., one for writing, one for analysis).

## Results & Optimization

**Q: What if the AI doesn't follow my persona instructions?**
A: Try being more specific in your requests, or add clarifying details to your persona. Some AIs respond better to certain instruction formats.

**Q: How do I know if my persona is working well?**
A: You should notice more relevant responses, less need to re-explain context, and outputs that match your preferred style and quality standards.

**Q: Can I share my persona with my team?**
A: Yes! This is a great way to ensure consistent AI assistance across your organization. You can share the persona text directly, or use platform-specific sharing features like Claude Projects (team collaboration) or invite team members to your Perplexity Spaces.

**Q: What's the difference between manual persona use and custom instructions?**
A: Manual use requires pasting the persona for each new conversation. Custom instructions (ChatGPT), Projects (Claude), or Spaces (Perplexity) apply your persona automatically to all new chats in that context, making it much more convenient for regular use.

## Business & Professional Use

**Q: Is it worth creating personas for occasional tasks?**
A: Personas work best for recurring work. For one-off tasks, a detailed prompt might be more efficient than creating a full persona.

**Q: How do personas help with team collaboration?**
A: Team members using the same persona get consistent AI assistance, maintaining quality standards and communication style across projects.

**Q: Can personas help with learning new skills?**
A: Absolutely! A well-designed learning persona can provide structured guidance, track your progress, and adapt to your learning style.

## Privacy & Security

**Q: Is it safe to include company information in my persona?**
A: Only include information you're comfortable sharing with AI platforms. Avoid sensitive data, passwords, or confidential business details.

**Q: Can other people see my persona?**
A: No, your persona instructions are private. Only you (and any team members you share with) have access to your custom personas.

**Q: What if I need to update my persona with new company policies?**
A: Simply edit your persona instructions to reflect new requirements, standards, or procedures. The AI will follow the updated guidelines immediately.
